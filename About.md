# About Super Happy Dev House Oregon

## Our Mission

Super Happy Dev House Oregon exists to:

- ü§ù Foster a welcoming tech community in Salem, Corvallis, and Monmouth
- üìö Encourage knowledge sharing across all skill levels
- üí° Provide space for people to work on passion projects
- üåê Connect developers, designers, makers, and tech enthusiasts
- üöÄ Support learning through hands-on collaboration

## History

### The Original SHDH

Super Happy Dev House was born in Silicon Valley in 2005, created by David Weekly and friends as an alternative to traditional tech meetups. The concept was simple: bring your laptop, work on whatever you want, and help others when you can.

The original SHDH grew into an international movement, with events happening in cities around the world. Each maintained the core values:
- Non-commercial
- Inclusive
- Creative
- Collaborative

### Why Oregon?

The Mid-Willamette Valley has a growing tech community spread across multiple cities. We have:
- Oregon State University in Corvallis
- Western Oregon University in Monmouth
- State government tech workers in Salem
- Remote workers and freelancers throughout the region
- Makers, artists, and creative technologists

Yet these communities rarely intersect. SHDH Oregon bridges these gaps, creating a regular space for cross-pollination of ideas and skills.

## What Makes SHDH Different

- No competition
- No prizes
- No mandatory presentations
- Work at your own pace

### Not a Networking Event
- No business cards required
- No elevator pitches
- No recruiting (keep it light)
- Focus on building, not selling

### Not a Class
- No curriculum
- No teachers (everyone teaches)
- No grades
- Learn by doing and sharing

## Our Values

### üåà Inclusivity
Everyone is welcome regardless of:
- Skill level

## Event Philosophy

### The Format

2. **Work Time** - The main event (3+ hours of hacking)
3. **Lightning Talks** - Optional 5-minute shares
4. **Cleanup** - We leave spaces better than we found them
