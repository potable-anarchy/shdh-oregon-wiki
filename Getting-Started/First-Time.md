- [ ] Charge your laptop
- [ ] Review the [[Code-of-Conduct|Getting-Started/Code-of-Conduct]]

## Common Questions

### "I don't have a project idea"
Perfect! You can:
- Browse our [[Project-Ideas|Resources/Project-Ideas]] list
- Help someone else with their project
- Learn a new technology
- Work through a tutorial
- Fix a bug in open source

### "I'm a complete beginner"
Even better! SHDH is a great place to:
- Get unstuck on problems
- Find mentors
- Learn by watching others
- Ask "stupid" questions (they're not stupid)

### "I'm not a programmer"
No problem! Hacking includes:
- Design and UX
- Data analysis
- Content creation
- Hardware projects
- Digital art
- Game development
- Whatever involves making things with technology

### "Can I come late/leave early?"
Absolutely! Come and go as needed. The introduction circle is helpful but not mandatory.

### "Do I have to present?"
Nope! Lightning talks are completely optional. Many people never present, and that's fine.

### "Can I work on commercial projects?"
Yes, but keep the commercial aspects low-key. No pitching, recruiting, or selling to other attendees.

## Social Dynamics

### How to Get Help
1. **Look around** - See if someone seems less busy
2. **Ask politely** - "Hey, when you have a minute, could you help me with X?"
3. **Be specific** - "I'm trying to do Y but getting error Z"
4. **Respect no** - People might be in the zone

### How to Help Others
1. **Be approachable** - Smile, make eye contact
2. **Offer help** - "I know a bit about X if you need help"
3. **Don't takeover** - Guide, don't grab the keyboard
4. **Admit limits** - "I don't know" is valuable

### Conversation Starters
- "What are you working on?"
- "How's your project going?"
- "That looks interesting, what is it?"
- "I'm stuck on X, have you ever dealt with Y?"
- "Want to pair program on this?"
